## ðŸ”§ Project Governance & Leadership

BareMetal is an open-source project with a clear mission: optimize game engines for photorealism on low-end GPUs, and challenge the hardware upgrade treadmill.

The project founder retains final say over:
- Project philosophy
- Appointing or replacing technical leads
- Major direction or feature shifts

We welcome passionate contributors and technical leaders â€” but anyone in a leadership role is expected to:
- Respect the core vision
- Maintain open, constructive communication
- Foster a culture of innovation without ego

Lead developers, coordinators, or moderators may be rotated or replaced at any time based on alignment, contribution quality, or community trust.

This is a merit-based rebellion â€” and the mission comes first.
