# BareMetal Engine

**Photorealism. Lowest GPU possible. Always.**

> ⚠️ **The industry lied to us.**
> 
> Since the beginning of gaming, we've been told that better experiences require more powerful hardware — that every few years, we must upgrade our GPUs, buy new consoles, and accept bloated engines as the price of progress.
> 
> But the truth is simpler — and more liberating: **we never needed more power, just better code.**
> 
> BareMetal exists to break that cycle. To prove that photorealism doesn’t demand top-tier silicon — it demands smarter engineering. This is a rebellion against GPU dependency, AAA bloat, and the idea that only corporations can make beautiful games.
> 
> If you've ever questioned the upgrade treadmill — you're not alone. Welcome to the resistance.

## 🔧 What Is BareMetal?
BareMetal is an open-source, ultra-optimized game engine forked from Godot with a radical goal:

> Run photorealistic graphics on the lowest possible hardware — and expose the industry's obsession with GPU bloat.

## The Problem: How Power Killed Progress

For decades, we’ve been sold a lie:

That in order to achieve better graphics, we need **bigger GPUs**.  
More cores. More memory. More power.

Meanwhile, game engines have grown **bloated**, **inefficient**, and **dependent**.  
Developers offload lighting, shadows, reflections—even resolution—onto the GPU at runtime, instead of building these effects intelligently into the game itself.

This is not innovation.  
This is _**laziness by design**_ — and it’s killing creativity.

- **AMD and NVIDIA** grow profits  
- **Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo** build “more powerful” consoles  
- **Developers** get lazier  
- **Engines** grow slower  
- **Players** get locked into an upgrade cycle they can’t afford

All while **90% of what’s rendered is invisible to the human eye.**

### This is the feedback loop we are breaking.

We believe that true advancement comes not from **brute-forcing hardware**,  
but from **mastering the engine**.

The game engine should be the source of **illusion** and **artistry** — not the GPU.

> You wouldn’t build a bigger car engine before optimizing the fuel.  
>  
> So why are we maxing out GPUs before maxing out the game engine?

### 🧠 The Paradigm Shift: Code Over Consumption

Instead of a hardware arms race, we’re creating a **code race**:
- Who can write the most elegant, efficient, and performant engine?
- Who can help the most people game and build without gatekeepers?
- Who can liberate the next generation of devs from GPU dependence?

The answer won’t come from billion-dollar boardrooms.  
It will come from **millions of developers** uniting around one mission:  
> **Make high-end graphics possible for everyone, on any machine.**

### ⚖️ The Two Paradigms

| **The Current Paradigm**                                     | **The New Paradigm**                                               |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Graphics improve → **GPUs must become more powerful**        | Graphics improve → **Engines must become more optimized**           |
| More power = more heat, more cost, more e-waste              | Smarter code = same graphics on cheaper hardware                    |
| Indie devs pushed out by hardware demands                    | Indie devs empowered to build AAA-tier games                        |
| Gamers forced to upgrade hardware                            | Gamers play on what they already have                               |
| Corporations profit through dependence                       | Developers and players win through freedom                          |

### 🌎 Why Everyone Wins

- 💸 **Gamers** save money — no more forced upgrades.
- 🚀 **Indie developers** build stunning games without licensing fees or AAA pipelines.
- 🌍 **Global access** expands — beautiful games, even on modest machines.
- 🔌 **Environmental impact** shrinks — less e-waste, less power draw.
- 🛠 **Engineering is reborn** — from brute-force back to craftsmanship.

BareMetal isn’t just an engine.  
It’s a rebellion.  
It’s a correction.  
It’s the beginning of the end for GPU tyranny.

**Join us. Optimize everything. Outcode everyone. Build the future.**

### 🔥 Our Mission

The modern gaming industry has locked photorealism behind $1,000 GPUs and wasteful engines. We believe:

- Optimization is more powerful than hardware.
- Photorealism should be possible on a GTX 1060, Steam Deck, or less.
- Game engines should empower creators — not gatekeep them.
- The upgrade treadmill is a lie. Let’s prove it.

### 💡 Key Goals

- Strip Godot to the bone and optimize for *performance-first*.
- Deliver playable demos with AAA visuals on mid-tier GPUs.
- Build a contributor community of rebels, engineers, and artists.
- Force the industry to reckon with the truth: **they've been wasting your hardware for profit**.

### 🛠 Want to Help?

We're looking for:

- Engine contributors (C++, Rust, Godot hackers)
- Shader optimization experts
- 3D artists who love performance
- Indie devs tired of Unity/Unreal lies
- Philosophers of efficient design
