# BareMetal Engine

**Photorealism. Lowest GPU possible. Always.**

BareMetal is an open-source, ultra-optimized game engine forked from Godot with a radical goal:

> Run photorealistic graphics on the lowest possible hardware — and expose the industry's obsession with GPU bloat.

🛠️ **Where’s the Code?**  
The stripped-down, AGPL-protected engine lives here:  
👉 [baremetal-engine-core »](https://github.com/baremetal-engine/baremetal-engine-core)

We're actively gutting the bloat and optimizing for *brutal efficiency*.

### 🔥 Our Mission

The modern gaming industry has locked photorealism behind $1,000 GPUs and wasteful engines. We believe:

- Optimization is more powerful than hardware.
- Photorealism should be possible on a GTX 1060, Steam Deck, or less.
- Game engines should empower creators — not gatekeep them.
- The upgrade treadmill is a lie. Let’s prove it.

### 💡 Key Goals

- Strip Godot to the bone and optimize for *performance-first*.
- Deliver playable demos with AAA visuals on mid-tier GPUs.
- Build a contributor community of rebels, engineers, and artists.
- Force the industry to reckon with the truth: **they've been wasting your hardware for profit**.

### 🛠 Want to Help?

We're looking for:

- Engine contributors (C++, Rust, Godot hackers)
- Shader optimization experts
- 3D artists who love performance
- Indie devs tired of Unity/Unreal lies
- Philosophers of efficient design
