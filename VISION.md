# BareMetal Engine Vision

## 🔥 A New Era in Game Development

**BareMetal exists to decentralize the power held by AAA studios and GPU manufacturers** — by proving that photorealistic, high-performance games can be achieved through radical optimization, not expensive hardware.

This isn’t just an engine.  
This is a correction. A rebellion. A new trajectory for gaming.

## 💣 The Problem

Today’s industry is locked into a cycle:

- Game engines are bloated
- Hardware upgrades are mandatory
- AAA games demand GPUs most people can’t afford
- Indie devs are shut out by licensing fees, hardware ceilings, and technical gatekeeping

AAA studios have partnered with hardware giants to **manufacture dependency**.

---

## 🧠 The Solution: BareMetal

> **Run photorealistic graphics on the lowest possible GPU — always.**

We forked Godot and began rebuilding it with brutal performance efficiency as the top priority. Every decision is filtered through one question:

> *Can we make this run beautifully on a mid-tier or even low-tier GPU?*

No vendor lock-in. No ray-tracing dependency. No $2,000 GPU requirement.

Just raw optimization.

## 🌍 Decentralization by Design

BareMetal is a tool for **freedom and decentralization**:

| Feature | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| 🔓 Open-source (AGPL) | No one can privatize or lock away improvements |
| 🧠 Community-built | Contributors from around the world, not one corporate boardroom |
| 🧮 Efficient by default | Enables devs in any economy to compete with AAA visual quality |
| 💸 No fees | Keep what you build. No royalties. No EULAs. No legal traps. |
| 🛠️ Developer ownership | You own your pipeline. You control your destiny. |

## 🎮 Why AAA Studios Should Be Nervous

If BareMetal succeeds, the industry loses:
- Its justification for hardware inflation
- Its monopoly on high-end visuals
- Its ability to extract royalties from every successful game

The lie that **“you need new hardware for better games”** collapses.

## 🚀 The Future We’re Building

- A world where indie devs ship stunning games from laptops.
- A future where no player has to upgrade for shallow graphics gains.
- A movement that values optimization, creativity, and freedom over flash, waste, and control.

## 🧭 Our Invitation

If you’ve ever:

- Stared at a laggy game menu and thought: *“How is this slow on a $1,500 rig?”*
- Wanted to create games without paying for your engine
- Hated watching good ideas crushed by corporate pipelines
- Believed that smart code beats brute force

Then you already believe in BareMetal.

> Let’s build the engine that flips the industry.
