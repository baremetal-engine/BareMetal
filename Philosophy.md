# The BareMetal Philosophy

## 🎯 Prime Directive

> **To run photorealistic graphics on the lowest possible GPU. Always.**

Every line of code, every asset decision, every rendering pipeline in this engine exists to serve this one goal.

---

## ⚔️ The Problem

Modern game engines are bloated. They’re optimized for silicon, not for users. The result?

- Beautiful games that run like garbage on anything but the latest GPU
- Indie devs locked out by complexity and cost
- Forced obsolescence every 2–3 years
- An industry built on fake “progress”

This isn’t innovation. It’s manipulation.

## 🔁 The New Trajectory

> The gaming industry pushes the limits of **hardware**.  
> **We push the limits of the engine.**

What Unreal and Unity do with 4080s, we aim to do with 1060s.  
And every time we succeed, we break the illusion that you need more power to have better games.

---

## 🚀 Why Open Source?

- So no corporation can claim or lock away our tools
- So anyone, anywhere, can contribute or build with it
- So we can prove — in public — what they told you was impossible

---

## 🧠 This Is More Than a Project

This is a **rebellion**.  
This is a **correction**.  
This is a **liberation of gaming** from the hardware treadmill.

We’re not trying to match the industry.  
We’re trying to **reverse its trajectory**.

## 📢 Call to Action

- Fork this engine.
- Help us strip it down and sharpen its edge.
- Build a demo that makes the world ask: *“Why does this run better on a 2016 card than modern AAA games?”*

If you’ve ever stared at a stuttering menu and thought:
> *“Why is this slow on a $2,000 PC?”*

You belong here.

> **Optimize the fuel, not the engine.**
